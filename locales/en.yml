        Some obviously invented bibliography citations make me sure it's a
        spoof, although it's very well done.

        As far as I could understand, they look like a corpus of spoof
        articles. I might even be wrong, in that case I'm sorry but I prefer
        making a fool of myself than being involved in a case in a few days.

        I'm sorry if I forgot to report them already. IMHO they are to be
        killed, on sight.

    marketing_title_1: Who was Enucatl?
    marketing_content_1: >
        Enucatl is the brother of Quetzalcoatl who lacks feathers; he's
        usually depicted as a snake with bat wings, a sharp bifurcate tail,
        a red mop, an elongated crocodile muzzle with deadly tusks.
    marketing_title_2: The good Satrapame
    marketing_content_2: >
        known, among the many aztec kings, for having put an end to the
        Sacred Mysteries, regularly devoted to the god Enucatl, and to the
        iconoclast fury that his predecessor, the tyrant Maurus, had
        unleashed against other cults.
    marketing_title_3: The bloodthirsty tyrant Maurus
    marketing_content_3: >
        his name is not aztec: the Spanish wrongly translated the adjective
            mah-urr (with a dark soul), as he was described by the
            population, still terrified after two centuries.
    featurette_title_1: The true story of Enucatl
    featurette_content_1: >
        starts in the first days of July 2007, when I was reading Umberto
        Eco's "Foucault's pendulum" and using the T9 by Nokia. That is the
        author of most of the made-up words in the story. The very name of
        Enucatl is the T9 spelling of Foucault.

        The undeniably aztec-sounding name (similar to Quetzalcoatl)
        triggered a rewriting of almost half a century of history. All
        begins in year 1300, with the birth of the tyrant Maurus (clearly
        from "tyrannosaurus") who meets the cult of Enucatl at an extremely
        young age, and decides to impose it by force after getting control
        over the army. Enucatl is the brother of Quetzalcoatl without
        feathers, and is tauroboliaste and psychopomp (again quoting the
        "Pendulum") in the mesoamerican mythology. After many years of cruel
        reign, the tyrant Maurus is overthrown by his cousin, the good
        Satrapame, who will bring peace back.

        The story was published in three articles on the Italian Wikipedia
        for about a week, July 8th to 15th 2007. It was then found out as a
        spoof because of the fake bybliography and some dates which were
        wrong by a few years, such as the foundation of Tenochtitlan. The
        hilarious discussion on the articles is still available on
