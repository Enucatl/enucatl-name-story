<h2 class='featurette-heading'>The tyrant Maurus</h2>
<p class='lead'>
Aztec <i>speaker</i> (1300-1322), he lived a really short life.
He has been considered as slightly less than a legendary
figure for centuries, and his historicity was confirmed after the
thorough research of John C. Gnostolds in the temple belt, in
Mexico, published in his book
<i>
Tyrant Maurus — A history about Enucatl's legacy XIV Century
to XX
</i>.

<h2>Childhood and the cult of Enucatl</h2>
<p class='lead'>
Son of Nahuatl, commander of the army of Tenochtitlan, and of the princess
Hemutillin, cousin of the king Azazale. He immediately seemed excluded from
succession since he was not close in kinship to the sovereign.
</p>
<p class='lead'>
His life changed radically as he met the bloody cult of Enucatl,
already at the age of nine: he joined the sect that honored this deity
and entered the <i>sacred mysteries</i> after a troubled mystic crysis,
involving self-mutilation and visions of afterlife, which molded
his young personality. suo carattere ancora giovanissimo.
He quickly became bold, unscrupulous, arrogant, as his blind faith in Enucatl
supported every endeavor; at twelve he convinced his uncle Azazale to send
him to the sacred town of Sobbabia to train as a priest, thus defeating
his mother's opposition (his father in the meanwhile had fallen in battle
against the tlaxcaltechs): under the wing of a supreme priest only
known as Ascetic Flower, he grew up in the most sectarian, burning religious
fanatism, and came to the conclusion that the Aztecs, as well as
the neighboring populations, could be united under one god, that
had to be imposed by force if necessary.

<h2>Military career and rise to power</h2>
<p class='lead'>
At fifteen, Maurus got exemption from mandatory school and joined the army:
he feverishly trained for two years and, as a tribute for his courage and
blind abnegation, received the command of an important border garrison,
close to the tlaxcaltec border. Exploiting his conidition of
<i>quasi-king</i>
in the garrison, he pushed his men to renounce the traditional faith,
and recognize Enucatl as the only god; the few who had the force to
oppose him, in spite of his fanatical zeal, had to suffer what later
came to be known as the
<i>tyrant's torture</i>:
crucified upside-down, after their tongue had been pulled out, they were
drowned several times into boiling water. The same policy of forced conversion
was carried out in the nearby tlaxcaltec villages, many of which were
destroyed for having refused the new god.
The warriors of the garrison under Maurus obeyed only his orders,
neglecting any news from the capital: they massacred defenceless
populations and converted the survivors. Moreover, many warriors
from other garrisons or off-duty converted spontaneously and joined
Maurus' army. He could count on more than three thousand men.
</p>
<p class='lead'>
The death of Azazale, June 1319, was followed by six months of anarchy:
no heir had been designated, and the council of the priests was hesitant
to name any, despite that being their jurisdiction.
Many generals, including the good Satrapame, proclaimed themselves king,
relying on support from their soldiers. During the night of December 31st 1320
(also known as <i>night of the reed</i>), Maurus marched on the capital
Tenochtitlan, supported by a cheering mob, and defeated two of the generals
who had joined forces against him. He entered Tenochtitlan, where he
ordered the destruction of the statues of the
<i>false gods</i>,
and decided to sacrifice who, among the prisoners of that night,
did not submit and convert to the new faith. Thousands died.

<h2>Tyrant Maurus' reign</h2>
<p class='lead'>
In March 1320 Maurus was forced by an epidemic that had struck Tenochtitlan,
to come to a compromise with the last remaining usurper, the good Satrapame:
in exchange for the acknowledgement of Maurus as the king, he would marry
his sister Tzitziplin, just twelve years old, and would be named heir.
After nine months, the military anarchy had ended.
</p>
<p class='lead'>
But a new season of violence started: Maurus' iconoclast fury
struck monuments, temples and sacred fences of other gods;
the
<i>tyrant's torture</i>
was ruthlessly and repeatedly inflicted upon enemies and subjects;
the tlaxcaltec reigns were conquered and ten thousand prisoners,
faithful to the ancient traditions, where sacrificed on Enucatl's pyramid,
in the sacred town of Sobbabia
— according to the chronicles, seven days of uninterrupted massacre were needed.
Taxes were raised to support a more and more ferocious and hardened army.
</p>
<p class='lead'>
In the countryside, the cult was profoundly radicated: the
faithful of the snake-god, known as
<i>ajaxes</i>,
often assaulted cities without fortifications, thus forcing
the conversion of the trading and artisan town bourgeoisie.
Finally the epidemic that had struck Tenochtitlan was not yet over,
and the canals of the town were filled with rotten corpses.
</p>
<p class='lead'>
The situation, during the two years of tyrant Maurus' reign, became
more and more unbearable: the religious intolerance, the forced conversions,
the tortures, the massacres in the towns and in the countryside,
the high taxation, the never-ending wards against
Chichimecs and Tlaxcaltecs induced the good Satrapame, Maurus' brother-in-law,
to overthrow him, on July 14th, 1322; that day became known as
<i>
the day of the glory
</i>.
The violent preacher of the cult of Enucatl, defeated and chained,
abandoned by all, was the last victim to be offered to the snake-god;
this violent and intolerant religion was then forever banned
— although, according to Spanish documents of the 16th century,
it lasted longer in the countryside, maintained by the
<i>ajaxes</i>.

<h2>
Final fall and
<i>damnatio memoriae</i>
</h2>
<p class='lead'>
The monuments that the tyrant Maurus had built, his sculptures and the paintings
of his victories were immediately destroyed; his name, erased from every
register of the country, was forgotted: the conviction for his cruel
actions was thus an eternal
<i>damnatio memoriae</i>.
So that his name, Maurus, is not Aztec: the Spanish wrongly translated
the adjective
<i>mah-urr</i>
(with a dark soul), as he was described by the population, still
terrified after two centuries.
