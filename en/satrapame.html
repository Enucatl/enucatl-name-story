Satrapame
<span class='text-muted'>known as the good</span>
</h2>
<p class='lead'>
Aztec <i>speaker</i> from 1322 to
1351, known, among the many aztec kings, for having put an end to
the Sacred Mysteries in honor of the god Enucatl and to the
iconoclast fury that his predecessor, the tyrant Maurus,A had
unleashed against other cults.
</p>
<h2>The civil war</h2>
<p class='lead'>
After the death of Azazale in 1319, the good Satrapame was just 45 years old,
but had been in command of five thousand warriors for ten years. They were
hardened by battles, rigidly disciplined and faithful to their commander,
who had set himself up as a feudal lord in an inhospitable region
of the Bradorose desert, near the northern border of the Aztec empire.

<p class='lead'>
The news of the death of the monarch was providential: some
maintain (in particular Edward J. Gnostolds, son of the better
known anthropologist
John C. and a successor in his research,
<i>Tyrant Maurus and the Good Satrapames — Anarchy and civil war in the Ancient Mexico</i>)
that he knew about the trafficking between the good Satrapame
and the populations living across the border
&mdash; cocoa seeds,
gems, weapons, hallucinogenic plants &mdash; and that he was
about to guide an army against his unfaithful vassal.
As soon as he was informed about the vacancy of the throne,
his personal army hailed him emperor (July 4th 1319):
the documents from that time attest his hesitation,
finally resolved after the revolt of the future tyrant Maurus
was uncovered.
</p>
<p class='lead'>
Six months of civil war followed, a period of military anarchy during which
five self-proclaimed emperors fought bloody battles.
No detailed description of those arrived to these days, but
it is a fact that during the <i>night of the reed</i> (December 31st 1319)
the tyrant Maurus took control of the capital Tenochtitlan with a
clever <i>coup</i>, and that only an epidemic avoided a battle between
the forces of Maurus and Satrapame. The treaty between the two usurpers
foresaw that Satrapame recognized his rival as the king;
in return, he would marry his sister Tzitziplin, 12 years old, and would
be named his successor. Satrapame gladly accepted.

<h2>The reign of the good Satrapame</h2>
<p class='lead'>
In the following months, the growing hate of the people
against the religious intolerance of the tyrant Maurus
induced Satrapame to overthrow him on July 14th 1322
(<i>day of the glory</i>); the removed despot was sacrificed
on Enucatl's altar and his cult was forever banned.
</p>
<p class='lead'>
So began twenty-nine years of enlightened government: the good
Satrapame extended the fortifications that used to belong to him
on the northern border, in order to defend the empire from
the hordes of primitives who were pressuring the frontier;
their overambitious attempt of forcing the defensive system
induced the general Cuahumatl, commander of the warrior
<i>élite</i>
of the
Cuahchiqueh and close friend of the good Satrapame, to attack the enemy.
A battle of epical proportion saw one thousand Aztec warriors fight against
twenty thousand strangers, and claim an overwhelming victory.
The prisoners
— not many, to say the truth — were killed on the fortifications
on the day of their inauguration.
</p>
<p class='lead'>
Satrapame rewarded Cuahumatl by naming him his successor; unceasing rumors,
collected by the archaeologist Jean-Pierre Donatien
(<i>Homosexualité et amour chez les Azthèques</i>),
spoke about a homosexual relationship between the two. The wife of the
<i>speaker</i> was infertile: she was secretly killed, and her body
thrown in the canals in Tenochtitlan.
But the work of the enlightened sovereign didn't stop: he ordered
the improvement and protection of the routes to the Yucatan,
and sent many explorative missions up to the coast of the Pacific Ocean.
He built many temples dedicated to the god Quetzalcoatl,
asking for his return from the western sea; he established an
alliance with the Tlaxaltechs that would last twenty years,
thanks to which he could lead wars in the south of the country.
He reformed the calendar, adding five days every twenty years
in order to avoid a difference between the mathematical prediction
and the flow of the seasons.
He issued various laws against the common practice of duelling
— apparently without much success; he collected in one <i>corpus</i>,
divided in ten books, ancient religious and legal traditions of his people.

<h2>Madness and disgrace.</h2>
<p class='lead'>
In the last years of his life, he was struck by madness; he
sentenced his new wife, Hematlel, to death for having accused him
of impotence (1347); he had all the servants of the royal house whipped
because they could not find a bracer he had lost; he demolished the
houses of his political opponents, who became more and more audacious
with his madness and dared to speak against him in public;
he started to doubt even his general Cuahumatl, who, fearing for his
own life, moved his soldiers to attack the royal palace.
In 1351 the good Satrapame was removed and imprisoned;
Cuahumatl did not name himself as king, but hailed the
young and controllable Cajalcoyotl as a ruler,
pulling the strings for the following twelve years.
Satrapame, blind and crazy, died after fourteen days in jail.
