<h2 class='featurette-heading'>Enucatl</h2>
<p class='lead'>
Divinity in the ancient aztec mythology. He is, in the tradition
of many mesoamerican parchments, the brother of Quetzalcoatl, from
which he differs by the lack of feathers; he is usually depicted as
a snake with bat wings, a sharp bifurcate tail, a red mop, an
elongated crocodile muzzle with deadly tusks.

He belongs to the group of chthonic deities, his main role is
tauroboliaste and psychopomp: his most important task is indeed
guiding the souls to the Mictlan, the underworld of precolombian
religions. According to the legends, it was not rare that this
deity, known for his noble soul, would be moved to pity by the
dead, and allowed them to resurrect in their bodies: these events
were often followed by gigantic earthquakes, and sometimes by
powerful tsunamis. The research of the anthropologist John C.
Gnostolds (1898-1973), near the sacred town of Sobbabia, uncovered
many tombs with no bodies inside: a conclusive proof (as he
theorized in his major work,
<i>
The ancient cult of Enucatl — A scientific research on Mexican
holy cities 1961-68
</i>,
published in 1970) of the mass resurrection.

The temple belt that runs from Sobbabia to Tenochtitlan is a proof
of the devotion of the aztec people — as well as the mayan,
according to some artefacts found in the Yucatan peninsula — for
this deity: pyramids with rounded steps, 45 to 60 m high on
average, on top of which human sacrifices would be performed to
honor the god; with the decline of the aztec military power, and
therefore the lack of slaves, the temples in the belt of the
sacred towns were abandoned and fell into ruin. The cult of
Enucatl also came to an end (see John C. Gnostolds,
<i>
The ancient cult of Enucatl
— A scientific research on Mexican holy cities 1968-1973
</i>,
published in 1980). We have to say that Azazale was not the last
ruler of the Mexica dynasty to celebrate solemn ceremonies in the
complex in Sobbabia; after his death (1321) the tyrant Maurus
(1300-1322) succeeded him, but he was condemned to an almost complete
<i>damnatio memoriae</i>
for his extreme brutality; apparently, he gathered the army and
quickly defeated the neighboring peoples, who had dared to revolt,
and brought 10 000 prisoners to death in the honor of Enucatl.

The believers of the serpent-god resisted, mainly in the
countryside, with the name of
<i>ajaxes</i>;
but the arrival of the Spanish in 1521 lead to the destruction of
most of the documents on Enucatl and put an end to his
remembrance. Only in the '60s the research of John C. Gnostolds
restored part of the forever lost identity of this ancient deity.
